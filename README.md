# Metacritic-Game-Reviews-Sentiment-Analyzer

## Introduction ---->

Launched in year 2001, Metacritic has emerged as the foremost online review website that aggregates user reviews of video games, movies and music albums. For every game on Metacritic, the scores from each review are averaged into a single score, a weighted average of all ratings posted by users with member access. Metacritic aims to help consumers make informed decisions about investing their time and money on game entertainment. So which genre influence video games to become popular? Can game reviews get classified based on their sentiments? Which games have the most positive reviews? Can we identify the most positive and negative reviews and form visual representations? So basically, our prime objective is to categorize user reviews based on their positivity and visualize the general trend of games relevant to customers.

Data Acquisition ---->
Web Scraping -->
This project sets out to pull data by building a web scraper and automate the process of extracting data from the web. Metacritic is one such website which gave us a foothold in the data acquisition process for scraping game data. For the project, we have scraped the top 1000 games with respect to their metascore and userscore rating. We have built a web scraper in such a way that it goes on to a webpage of the web, scrapes relevant game data and then moves forward with the next webpage. Further, we have scraped close to 84000 reviews posted by the users for each of the 1000 games.

A. Part 1 â€“ Scraping Metacritic Game Elements/Game Links/User Review Links
In the part 1 of the scraping process, we have extracted a wide array of games and its elements using BeautifulSoup Library in python. Moreover, we also extracted game links and user review links for further scraping of inner html which comprises of reviews, ratings, and their review date.
